# The _Epiverse_ Initiative - Tooling outbreak response analytics (Working title)

## Presentation

- Need for coherent, reproducible, and reliable software for epidemiological modelling, particularly, outbreak response 
- The outbreak analytics automation (R) landscape is huge yet lacking visibility and coherence
- Epiverse attempts to fill some of gaps with an ecosystem of coherent and interoperable tools built in R
- Several pillars/themes, particularly pillar 2 (real-time analysis)
  - An example is {bpmodels}:
    - Simulates branching processes (BPs)
    - BPs are useful for answering questions around:
      - transmissibility and superspreading
      - supercritical and subcritical outbreaks (I'll break it down :slightly_smiling_face: )
    - Quick demo of {bpmodels}
    - Next steps: submission to CRAN, plan for updates and next release, etc
- Conclusion
